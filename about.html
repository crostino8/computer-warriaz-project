<h2>Arogya Badal</h2>
<br>
<p>Hi there, my name is Arogya Badal! I'm from Nepal and I love playing the guitar. My favorite band is Tribal Rain, which is actually from Sikkim. As for my hometown, it's a small city located in the central part of Nepal. It's surrounded by hills and there's a river that flows through it. The people there are really friendly and hospitable, and there's always something to do, whether it's hiking in the hills or enjoying a cup of tea at a local cafe.</p>
<br>
<p>I also enjoy programming and have some experience in JavaScript and React.</p>
<br>
<p>When it comes to my favorite books, I really enjoy reading fiction and non-fiction. Some of my all-time favorites include "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho, "The God of Small Things" by Arundhati Roy, and "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari. As for music, I'm a big fan of rock and indie music. I love listening to bands like Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys, and of course, Tribal Rain!</p>
